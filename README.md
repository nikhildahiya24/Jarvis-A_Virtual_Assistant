## Functionality 

The overall design of our system consists of the following phases: 


* [ ] Taking input from the user in the form of voice.
* [ ] Converting the speech into text to be processed by the assistant.
* [ ] The converted text is now processed to get the required results. 
* [ ] The text contains one or two keywords that determine what query is to be executed. If the keyword doesnâ€™t match any of the queries in the code, then the assistant asks the user to speak again.
* [ ] The result which is in the form of text is converted to speech again to give results to the user.
